For over 20+ years, networks have continued to grow organically while being managed manually by the command line on a device by device basis. Based on how networks have been architected and deployed, it makes it extremely difficult to introduce various forms of automation because each network in an organization was deployed by a different team or engineer with little structure or standard. If we fast forward to 2017 and beyond, the pace of which the business is demanding change cannot be sustained without better forms of network management and operations. As more change is introduced or as more devices are deployed, you should not have to hire more engineers — the answer lies with adopting better network operations — from culture and process, to people and automation. Using our unique blend of skill sets from DevOps, automation, software development, to the decades of collective network engineering experience we have, we help our clients gradually adopt better network operations practices through the use of automation while ensuring maximum benefit back to the business.
