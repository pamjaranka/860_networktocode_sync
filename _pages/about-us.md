Network to Code, LLC is a network automation consulting company and solution provider helping clients improve operational efficiencies and reduce costs while helping IT teams deliver services faster resulting in quicker time to market, faster recognition of revenue, and increased customer satisfaction. Network to Code was founded on the principles and belief that the way networks are currently being built, managed, and operated has to change. Thus, it is the company’s mission to drastically change the way networks are managed, consumed, and operated on a day to day basis. Simply put, Network to Code bridges the gap between DevOps, Software Development, and Network Operations. We accomplish this by providing services using a combination of commercial and off the shelf open source software (OSS) as well as integrating with existing client tools and technologies. Network to Code was founded in 2014 by Jason Edelman after recognizing most vendors, manufacturers, and systems integrators were, and still are, solely focused on selling hardware, design, and implementation services while not focusing in on the real challenge – Day 2 operations. Network to Code was founded on this premise – to help customers take control of their network through the use of software development and automation technologies while making the network and network automation much more consumable. Network to Code is headquartered in NYC and serves customers worldwide.
