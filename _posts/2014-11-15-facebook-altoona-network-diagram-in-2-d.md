Facebook recently wrote about the [network architecture](https://code.facebook.com/posts/360346274145943/introducing-data-center-fabric-the-next-generation-facebook-data-center-network/) they are using in their new Altoona data center facility.  If you haven't read through their article yet, it's definitely worth the read.

They have a few diagrams that outline the architecture.  One of them is in 3-D.  3-D diagrams are always more difficult for my brain to conceptualize (maybe it's just me), so I re-drew it in a more typical 2-D fashion.
There aren't details on quantity and speeds of ports for the spine and edge switches, so I represented them similar to how they have them in their diagram.  For every downward facing port a spine switch has (across the plane), 2300 servers can be added.  That's the amount of servers per pod.  48 servers per rack * 48 racks per pod = 2300 servers.  Based on the switch types being used, this number could be more, but I'm using the characteristics of 48 x 10G ports for host facing ports + 4 x 40G ports for uplinks.

My diagram depicts 8 racks in the POD and 8 switches per plane.  These numbers would be 48 in a fully built out network/diagram.

Feel free to comment and correct anything I may have mis-represented.

Update 11/17/2014: corrected number of edge pods.

Thanks,
