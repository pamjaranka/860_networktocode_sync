Last week I had the pleasure of speaking at Interop in NYC.  It wasn’t the best turn out for a conference, but all of the sessions that were about automation, APIs, DevOps, and programmability seemed to do fairly well.  For those that didn't attend, the title of the presentation was A Practical Look at Network Automation --- the deck is posted below.

I also had the opportunity to be a guest on Ivan Pepelnjak’s podcast Software Gone Wild recently and it was just posted yesterday.  Have a [listen](http://blog.ipspace.net/2014/10/network-automation-tools-with-jason.html).

Feel free to reach out with any questions or comments regarding any of the material.

Thanks,
Jason
