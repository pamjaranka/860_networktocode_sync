I changed things up this week and wrote an article on LinkedIn about the launch of the [Network to Code On Demand Labs platform](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/self-service-demand-network-infrastructure-jason-edelman?trk=pulse_spock-articles).

<!--more-->

It is a cloud based service that allows you to launch any number of network topologies in minutes for simulations, labs, demos, and testing.

Check it out if you want 22 hours free of on-demand network access to devices of your choice!


Thanks,

Jason
