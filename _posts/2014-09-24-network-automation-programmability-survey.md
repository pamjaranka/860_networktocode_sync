Many vendors collect their own data that is more than likely a little skewed and biased.  As I prepare for a few upcoming presentations, I thought it would be great to get some REAL data from REAL people doing great things or even those just starting on their automation journey.

If you would be kind enough, there is a link to a survey below that asks a few questions pertaining to network automation and programmability.  No personal information is required.

If you wish to see the results, please fill the survey out :)


Thanks in advance,
