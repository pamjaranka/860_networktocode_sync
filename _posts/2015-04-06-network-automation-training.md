If you are a frequent reader of my blog, you know that last year I left my job to do something that I was [intrinsically motivated](http://www.jedelman.com/home/taking-the-bull-by-the-horns) to do.  Unfortunately, because of this, I haven’t been able to write as much as I normally would.  I do hope that changes.  But, time is money now – literally.  My time has been spent driving business, negotiating, writing Scopes of Work, building a website, managing finances, and producing quality work for customers, and I hope all of that continues.

Up until this point, I’ve been focused on providing services to end user customers.  Today, I’m happy to say that I’ve officially launched the first, of hopefully many, training courses.  This one is focused on foundational skills as it pertains to network automation.  More detail can be found [here](http://networktocode.com/cisco-network-programming-automation/).

Training and Education are paramount for technology adoption and hopefully courses like this can play a small part with empowering network engineers to not only expand their skill set, but realize the value that could be had by these skills for their own organizations and employers.

As always, I’m open to comments and feedback below or through the contact page.


Thanks,
Jason
