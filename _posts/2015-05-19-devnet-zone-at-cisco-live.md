Going to Cisco LIVE?  Interested in chatting about network automation or about how DevOps principles can be used on the network?  Well, if you are, feel free to reach out - I would love to have a conversation out in San Diego!  I just booked a trip to Cisco LIVE, but am only purchasing the $49 DevNet Explorer pass.  This means I should have plenty of time to socialize and will likely be spending most of my time at the DevNet zone.  I'll have access to my remote lab and should be able to demo much of what I've posted about in the past few months too.
